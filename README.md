Chainsaw Tech Blog is a website where users can sign up or login to their account to see blog posts about the tech industry. <br> This website was built using an MVC paradigm. <br> MVC paradigm makes it easier to understand the functionality of the front end and back end. <br> The model and views folder contain all the back end work, while the views allows us to see what the user will experience. 

## Installation

To run the back end in this project, you will need to do an "npm install" to install express and sequelize packages. <br> 
An "npm start" command inside the terminal will start up the server to test out the user and post routes.
